# Interactive Maps with Folium!

Lab 5  
In this lab we learned a straightforward approach to creating maps in python with the folium package. We simply utilized pandas to organize our data into a simple table to reference, then used folium to create a chloropleth map referencing the columns in the table.  
I agree that using zip codes to map out data does not make much sense. Especially when the variable has an easy to map single location, such as the Starbucks. A starbucks only has 1 location - not all ovr a zip code.  
The other map we created was a much better use of a chloropleth.  
I can see how folium can be a very useful tool to use for map creation. One can easily prep the data in python, then view it straight away as a map. 
  
I played around with changing the map a bit and found folium has pretty good documentation.
